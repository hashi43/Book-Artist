# Book-Artist
“BOOK ARTIST” This project is a program announcer portal that is  implemented on a website also in android applications.
This project gives feature of remotely creating, removing, information retrieval, assigning tasks to different 
artist or band, etc for an event. The existing event management website only provide the basic contact details
about an artist or a team, user who need to book their program must contact them personally or search for another option.
But here user can search and book suitable artist or team very simply by using mobile application. Also anyone can register
as an artist or as a team leader. In our proposed system we are aiming to create an application using which the users can
find the profile and highlights of various artist or team with the help of data given. Here a user can view and book a program
by paying in advance using the mobile application without going there in person or contacting through any other methods.
He can book and schedule the program from the app so that he only needs to pay them correctly. Also, user can send feedback
and complaints about any program conducted, and rate them using android application. This project is capable of providing chat 
option between user and team leader.
